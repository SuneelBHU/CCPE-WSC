# CCPE-WSC

There are three sections of our code 

1. WSC: Proposed Algorithm WSC performance
2. TagingTech: Aging Technique Performance
3. Decentralization

Install all the dependencies
-pip install network
-pip install matplotlib

1. WSC: Proposed Algorithm WSC performance

Graph.py file creates all types of network graph
ExistingAlgorithm.py imports the Graph.py, runs the algorithm, and provides output to the run_script.py file
WSC_Algorithm.py imports Graph.py, runs the WSC algorithm, and provides the output data to the run_script.py file

The above three Python files are run through run_script.py 

Set the path as per your directories to save the performance graph 

#Run the script 

$python run_script.py

2. TagingTech: Aging Technique Performance

Set the path as per your directories to save the performance graph in the given folders
Run the script
$python Aging_performance.py


3. Decentralization

Deploy the script of the Existing algorithm and the Proposed Algorithm 
in Remix IDE 

For Existing Algorithm

-Click on the  GraphMatrix navigation button
-Click on the main_function navigation button

For Proposed Algorithm

-Click on the  GraphMatrix navigation button
-Click on the main_function navigation button


Compare the transaction cost and execution cost of both algorithms
